## Chemical Energy
-------------------

In some cases when the only consider the latency and sensitivity energy, but in the real world, there are several different types of energy. In thermodynamics the most important are the state energy, nuclear energy and chemical energy.



$$ \Delta E =  \Delta E_{state}  + \Delta E_{chemical} $$

For general purpose, we have to assume reference state, that some text suggest us that the state is at T = 25 ÂºC  and p = 1 atm
